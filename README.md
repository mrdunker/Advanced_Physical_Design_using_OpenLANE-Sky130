  <summary>Introduction to RISC-V</summary>
  <br />
  RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for computer processors.<br>
  An instruction set architecture defines the set of instructions that a processor can execute and the organization and behaviour of those instructions.
  RISC-V is unique in that any single company or organization does not own it. and it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and implement without 
  the need for licensing fees or proprietary restrictions.<br />  
  The RISC-V project began at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010, and it has since gained significant traction in both academia and industry.
  Its open nature has led to a growing ecosystem of hardware and software developers collaborating to create a wide range of products, from simple embedded 
  devices to high-performance supercomputers.
  <br/>
  Application software (apps) and hardware are linked by 'system software'.There are various layers of system softwar*. This includes major components like   
  Compiler and Assembler.<br />
  <br />
  The compiler compiles high-level codes like C and C++ to Instructions(eg: the codes inside .exe files) that can be read by the Assembler.<br />
  The Assembler converts it into binary codes which the machine can understand. The instructions act as an interface between the high-level language and the 
  machine language.<br />
  The converted binary is then given to an RTL snippet that understands the instruction. This is done by a Hardware Description Language (HDL).
  This is basically called RTL implementation and a netlist is being generated. with this, a physical design implementation of the design is generated.<br />

  <summary>SoC Design using OpenLane</summary>
  <br />
  Desiging Digital Application Specific Integrated Chip(ASIC) require several elements. They are as follows:

- RTL IP's
- EDA tools
- PDK tools
  <br />

### RTL IP's
RTL IP encompasses pre-constructed and pre-validated units of digital logic or functional modules, which are described at the register-transfer level (RTL). RTL serves as a hardware description level that
characterizes the operation of a digital circuit through data transfers between registers and logic operations. RTL IP cores represent reusable components that can be incorporated into more extensive ASIC or FPGA
designs. These cores encompass a range of functions, including processors, memory controllers, communication interfaces, and others. Designers frequently employ RTL IP to streamline the development of intricate
digital systems, thereby conserving time and resources.
<br />
### EDA tools
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are software applications that streamline the creation and validation of electronic circuits, encompassing ASICs, FPGAs, and other digital systems. These tools span across 
multiple phases of the design process, from the initial conceptualization to the ultimate physical realization.
<br />
### PDK tools
A Process Design Kit (PDK) encompasses a set of resources, including tools, libraries, and documentation, furnished by semiconductor foundries. These resources are designed to empower creators in fashioning ASICs 
and other integrated circuits, leveraging the foundry's unique manufacturing processes. PDK tools form an integral component of the PDK bundle, serving various essential functions.
